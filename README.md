# Snake and Hamburger

Building a version of the snake game in Python and Pygame.

:snake: :hamburger: *Snake and Hambuger* is a simple game where if snake eats an
hamburger it gets longer and your score increases. If your snake hits any part of
its body it will die. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down,
left or right) with the arrow keys and the snakeÂ´s body follows. Also, the player
can't stop the movement of the snake while the game is running.
